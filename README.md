x86
===

One of my school projects, written in x86 Assembly. Designed to be run on a 32 bit machine.

# hwk3.c

hwk3.c takes in command line args, ensures valid input, and calls the desired function

## triple.s

Takes in one number, triples it, returns it

## log2i.s

Returns the natural logarithm of the given number

## avgarray.s

Sums an array of ints and returns the average in floating point

## isprime.s

Tells you if a number is prime

## caller.s

Calls isprime.s on 2xn-1 (memory management exercise)

### Makefile

Needs some updating but does the job
